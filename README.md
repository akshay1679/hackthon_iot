# Securing Iot Networks Using Hybrid Optimization and Deep Learning Approach 

## Description
The Internet of Things (IoT) integrates devices, systems, and operations, providing seamless connectivity and data management. However, this interconnected nature also opens new pathways for cyber-attacks. Currently, IoT security faces significant threats from illegal downloads and malware, which can compromise sensitive information and lead to reputational and financial damage. This paper proposes a hybrid optimization mechanism combined with deep learning to prevent attacks in IoT systems. A comprehensive cybersecurity warning system is first developed by constructing an index system, selecting key factors, and evaluating potential threats. Several bio-inspired techniques are employed to improve intrusion detection systems (IDS) by reducing data dimensionality and filtering out unnecessary noise. The Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm, a bio-inspired technique, enhances the IDS's ability to detect both normal and abnormal network activity. The smart initialization step, which integrates advanced pre-processing strategies, ensures that informative features are incorporated early in the process. 

 Researchers utilized multi-source data in a big data environment to identify and validate index components. A parallel reduction approach, based on the classification significance matrix, is introduced to reduce underlying data characteristics. In this study, the Grey Wolf Optimization and Whale Optimization algorithms were combined to enhance attack prevention mechanisms, supported by a deep learning approach. The TensorFlow deep neural network was used to classify software and detect instances of plagiarism. Techniques such as tokenization and weighting were applied to reduce noise and emphasize the importance of specific terms in open-source software detection. Malware samples from the Mailing database were used for testing. Experimental results show that this approach offers superior classification performance compared to existing methods, effectively detecting attacks in IoT systems. Consequently, the Whale-Grey Wolf Optimization (WGWO) and deep convolutional network are applied to enhance IoT attack preventio
